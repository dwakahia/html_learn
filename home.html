    <h4 class="title">Short Bio</h4>
    <div class="underline"></div>


    <div class="bio-content">
        <p>Dolph Lundgren was born as Hans Lundgren in Stockholm, Sweden, to Sigrid Birgitta (Tjerneld), a language teacher,
            and Karl Johan Hugo Lundgren, an engineer and economist for the Swedish government. He lived in Stockholm until
            the age of 13, when he moved in with his grandparents in Nyland, Ã…ngermanland, Sweden. Despite an early interest
            in music and the fine arts, Dolph decided to follow in his father's footsteps and pursue an Engineering degree.
            After having completed his military service, he enrolled at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm.</p>

        <p>It was in the military when Dolph first came in contact with the martial arts. Five years later, he had become a
            world-class competitor in Japanese Karate and was deeply involved with a discipline that was to become an
            important part of his life. After graduating High School, Dolph spent considerable time studying in the United
            States and abroad on various academic scholarships. He attended Washington State University and Clemson
            University in South Carolina. In 1982, he received a scholarship to complete his Masters Degree in Chemical
            Engineering at the University of Sydney, Australia. In 1983, he was awarded a Fulbright scholarship to the
            Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Boston, one of the world's top engineering schools.</p>

        <p>Lundgren managed to not let his Hollywood career stand in the way of his athletic background. He has been awarded
            his Third Degree Black Belt by the World Karate Organization in Tokyo. His accomplishments include being the
            Captain of the Swedish National Karate Team, as well as a Champion of the Swedish, European and Australian
            Heavyweight Division titles. Lundgren still regularly performs Karate exhibitions at international tournaments
            worldwide. In addition, he was selected by the U.S. Olympic Committee to serve as Team Leader of the 1996 U.S.
            Olympic Pentathlon Team during the Atlanta Games. He is actively involved in promoting the image of this sport.
            His production company, Thor Pictures, is developing several projects in which he will produce, star and/or
            direct. He is also a founding member of "Group of Eight", a New York theater group started in 1994.</p>

        <p>undgren has reportedly been working on a fitness book and sports wear line for men, the creation and launch of a
            new eponymous brand, a licensing, media and publishing program, and the development of future entertainment and
            media projects. Lundgren was married to Anette Qviberg-Lundgren, an interior decorator and fashion designer,
            until their divorce in 2011. They had two daughters together.</p>
